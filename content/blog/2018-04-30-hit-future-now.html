<p>I have wanted to make a blog post to describe how I think we can extend the power of the Healthcare Information Technology environment. My focus has been on the development and the management of Healthcare I.T. since the late 1980’s. I have worked for several Health Systems, including Sutter Health, St. Luke’s Idaho, Tahoe Forest as an employee and as a consultant, I have worked with dozen’s of other Health Systems. I have had many different experiences in the industry including Strategic Planning, EHR Software Development, Data Science and managing Infrastructure and Operations.</p>
<p>I’m back in the consulting business now and I expect to be able to get as close as possible to the I.T. departments to enable their ability to adopt data analytics to improve their ability to deliver a good experience to the staff and others that deliver care. I’ve focused on this in the past and I used analytics to make sure that we are focused in the right areas. Healthcare IT needs to learn to innovate and to have a simple, stable, secure and sustainable environment. I will share my opinions on how to move forward in H.I.T.</p>
<p>My future posts will have a variety of topics which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Opportunity in Healthcare I.T.</li>
<li>Analytics in I.T.</li>
<li>Dev/Ops</li>
<li>Programming and Deploying the Language R</li>
<li>Programming and Deploying Language Python</li>
<li>Machine Learning and A.I.</li>
<li>Data Management and Governance</li>
<li>Using the Neo4j Graph Database to Analyze Healthcare</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many reasons I want to start getting the blog posts up and running. I do need to expose people to some of the analytics work and the tools that I’m using in our industry. I prefer that our industry adopts solutions that are the best for your experience, and the best in cost. I also want you to know that one of my main reasons to post to the blog is that since I’m working on a lot of different topics, I need a way to remember how I did this work. Writing about it tends to allow me to look backward to remember I accomplished something in the past. Yes, these blog posts are really all about me <i class="fa fa-2x fa-male"></i>. You will see more posts and details in the areas above in the near future.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
