<blockquote>
<p>Utilizing Natural Language Processing to predict text is interesting. I built a small little tool to test the NLP process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The video shows how to use this tool to predict text. I embedded this video within the application I wrote that utilizes the Natural Language Processing model I built to predict the next text word after you put them in place. I developed this when I was in the Data Science Capstone on-line course with John Hopkins University.</p>
