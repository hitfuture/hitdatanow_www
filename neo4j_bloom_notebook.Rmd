## My Focus

Enable Healthcare to create better health, better care and lower cost: (The triple aim)

*  Referral Paterns 
*  Care Delivery Optimization
*  Software Application Utilization and Integration
*  Fraud Detection
*  I.T. management
*  Common Data Model - Concept and Observations (OMOP)
*  Master Data Management

## Challanges 

### Autogenerate a Bloom Perspective for a large Graph Database 

One of my existing databases contains a high number of Node Labels and Relationship Types.  

Node count: 163,666,309   
Relationship Count:  150,173,322   
Label Count: 124   
Relationship Type Count: 459   

Query running for `r round(3389916 / 1000 / 60,1) ` minutes.  It continued to run right now and finally finished.  This database


The query will run for hours to detect the schema.   This probably could be optimized with Apoc - which may have its own issue since not all users install the apoc library.

### Geospatial Data

The word geospatial is used to indicate that data that has a geographic component to it.  This means that the records in a dataset have locational information tied to them such as geographic data in the form of coordinates, address, city, or ZIP code. GIS data is a form of geospatial data.  Other geospatial data can originate from GPS data, satellite imagery, and geotagging.

Geographic visualization would be great in the context of the geography of address where something takes place.  The
