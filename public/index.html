                            <p>I was thrilled to get my first job at Sutter Health's Surgery Department in my youth. I became very interested in the medical sciences and was focused on this part of the Healthcare industry.  Working with some of the great Neuro Surgeons, Orthopedic Surgeons, Anesthesiologists, Nurses, and others, I decided that I would take on education in the medical field.  My college experience at Sacramento City College was focused on biological sciences, mathematics, physics, and engineering.  Working in the O/R made me passionate about the future of Healthcare, and ended up keeping me in the industry for over thirty years. While I thought I would stay in the medical sciences, I ended up becoming extremely focused on applying software to the industry because I understood the opportunities in improving performance for Healthcare, and how I should create a better experience for the clinical staff so they could focus on their patients</p>

                            <p> When I had finished my first performance improvement project at Sutter Health, I was fortunate to become the 'Patient Care Operations Analyst' in the late 80s.  My role in this area was to analyze the operations of the nursing side of healthcare so that the leaders could help improve performance and reduce cost in the Hospital. I was able to apply statistics, and data management to enable a new capability for this organization.  This was a great transition from my former position, and I now could focus entirely on the analysis side of the world.  I had been doing this work for about a year, and then the manager in the I.T. department reached out to me to recruit me to work on the side of data analytics. </p> <p>As a Programmer Analyst, I was able to lead a project that was a Perinatal Management System that provided a data repository, and reporting applications to enable knowledge of this to providers, and administrators. I also took in the ability to re-engineer an existing mainframe-based system into a client/server application for the medical staff department at several facilities.  </p> <p> My next position at Sutter was a Strategic Planning Analyst focused on the deployment of the Healthcare Information System.  I also took on project management in multiple areas including the adoption of the right technology to enable Capitation based are</p><p>These jobs brought me full on to the technology side of healthcare, and I became very dedicated to the industry for the rest of my career. </p>

                            <h1>Data Focused Software Development</h1>
                            <p>My first job at a startup company was with a team that was developing a business analytics system for the healthcare domain.  My position was focused on the software development of the ability to create an interactive visualization system and would run on both Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows.  Our company succeeded in deploying this data-driven solution, and it was built in one of the first Object Oriented programming languages in the early 1990s.  After we sold the company, I became a consultant focused on data-driven development for the healthcare industry.  I worked for many years in different companies, and for some Health systems.  Development of these new solutions was a passion of mine, and I thought I'd never stop doing programming.  The truth is, even with leadership roles, I never did stop programming based on a data-driven world.   </p>

                            <h1>IT Leadership</h1>
                            <p>Much of my leadership positions have happened since the about 2006.  While I did have to lead roles in the past, when I was consulting for Tahoe Forest Health System in the data arena, I was given a new job in management.  That job evolved to where I became the 'Director of Development.'  This title was aligned with the term Dev/Ops which was established in technology in the late 2000s.  My role was associated with the deployment of new technologies for the organization.  I managed application deployment, business intelligence, and establishing a more stable environment. I left Tahoe Forest during the recession, and moved up to St. Luke's in Idaho to manage teams that were focused on installing a new hospital in Twin Falls.  That project was very successful, and the CIO put me into the role of the Director of Infrastructure and Operations.  My objective was to extend the culture and deploy stable technologies. This was definitely a challenge, and we made a lot of change during the five years I lead this large team.  In 2014, I realized that I still was obsessed with data, and I had taken on education in Data Science in my off time. It was fascinating, and I ended up going to a start-up company where I became the Chief Technology Strategist leading the development of Data Science solutions for Healthcare.  That was very exciting, and one of the important things was to adopt Dev/Ops in the realm of Data Science.  Leadership is essential, and sometimes challenging.  </p>

                        <p>Creating an exceptional experience for your workforce requires that you understand how you are delivering services to your organization. I have used data analytics to determine how well services are being delivered, and understand the risks and the value is being provided. This method enables the right amount of time and effort that an organization can spend to create an exceptional experience for the patients and the community you care for.</p>

I have been dedicated to adopting agile methodologies that allow you to deliver the right solution at the right time with a decent investment.  Development and Operations have been living in their own silos in the past.  To eliminate this, I have adopted Dev/Ops in my last Chief Technologist position so that we could deliver products correctly for our customers.  I can help you integrate your teams so that they are able to continuously deliver solutions that enable the care givers and the people that support them to provide a better patient experience, and to lower cost.</p>

                        <h3>Software Development</h3>
                        <p>I have provided software development in Healthcare, Banking, and some other areas over the last 30 years.  I have utilized multiple languages based on Object-Oriented Programming, and Functional languages which include Smalltalk, Java, C, R, Python, and other languages.    This makes sense with the adoption of the Electronic Health Record. I have had the ability to do this development for product development at Software development companies, and verticles in the areas of Healthcare, Banking, and Consulting businesses. I always love to keep my hands on the keyboard, and learn new languages so I will continue to keep programming moving forward. I tend to always integrate this work into the data side of the world, and you can see my skills that handle this area.</p>

                        <h3>Legacy System Archiving</h3>
                        <p>One area that I have built a product for based on my own company is the creation of a Legacy system archive soltuion.  Legacy systems are applications should soon no longer be in service because they are being replace (or already have), yet the access to the information from the system from the past is required.  I developed a solution for claims archiving back in 2004 that ran on a co-location data center and it was web based.  I made the system secure through proper authentication, and I also created good features for the customer. In the future as an I.T. leader, I took on reducing the cost of legacy systems, and had a team focused on minimizing our efforts to support these old systems.  This is important, and you can see more information about this by clicking on the button.</p>

                        <h3>R Statistics</h3>
                        <p>Moving forward in Healthcare requires Analytics being applied to the data that you have access to. The language R is one of the top 2 languages used in this arena.  In fact, this website was built on a toolset that was developed by R-Studio to allow simple work occur for data scientist and statiticians.  The language R has over 12000 packages that were designed to enable Data Scientists and statiticians to rapidly take on analytics and Machine Learning. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> The language has not only grown over the last 30 years, the environment platforms have also.  &lt;a href='https://www.rstudio.com&rsquo;target=_blank&gt;R-Studio<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, &lt;a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/rebranding-microsoft-r-server&rsquo;target=_blank&gt;Microsoft R Analytics<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and &lt;a href='https://shinyproxy.io&rsquo;target=_blank&gt;Open Analytics<!-- raw HTML omitted --> have developed some great environments that enable you to work with this environment in the enterprise.</p>

                        <p>Python is the fastest growing language in the world. The reason is that there is a lot of value in this language since it is both functional, has a good environment for Object-Oriented programing.  My personal experience with Python is in the realm of Data Science and Data management.  I use it to enable good access to data, and to analyze data well.  I have developed several solutions based on Python, and I expect that I will continue to use it, and R in the Data Science realm.</p>

                        <p>My experience in my career has been very focused on data to analyze and predict the future in the medical industry. To make this successful, I have been accountable for managing the data. Data management is critical, I have extended it in the areas of governance and project management. Since I have utilized diverse types of databases, and other data sources, I understand the challenges with managing data and implementing better solutions to allow for proper management. I have applied Machine Learning to understand data better, with tools like classification, clustering, and also using Natural Language Processing (N.L.P.). I also have built out rule-based systems to understand complex data better.</p>

                        <p>I have been very lucky to become an official leader in the Healthcare Industry over the last 13 years.  In the start of my career, I always wanted to the data analysis and development side of the world so I avoided taking on official jobs as a manager.  Since I did have my own consulting business, I was a leader, yet I didn&rsquo;t recognize that that was one of my skills.  I became a director at a Healthsystem when I was consulting to handle data integration work, and they hired me.  It ended up that I really like working with teams, and realize that being a leader, means that you are listening to the experts that report to you, and taking on the best advise you can get from them.  Communication is one of the most important parts of this world, and as I&rsquo;ve learned, you really need to handle non-verbal communication as well as verbal communication.  Taking on leadership has been fun, and you can see some of my non-verbal communication by clicking on the icon above.</p>
