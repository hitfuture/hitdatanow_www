      <description>Phases Preoperative The preoperative phase is used to perform tests, attempt to limit preoperational anxiety and may include the preoperative fasting.
 Perooperative The peroperative period begins when the patient is transferred to the operating room table and ends with the transfer of a patient to the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU). During this period the patient is peroperatively monitored, anaesthetized, prepped, and draped, and the operation is performed. Nursing activities during this period focus on safety, infection prevention, and physiological response to peroperative anaesthesia.</description>

      <description>I have wanted to make a blog post for awhile to describe how I think we can extend the power of the Healthcare Information Technology environment. My focus has been on the development and the management of Healthcare I.T. since the late 1980’s. I have worked for several Health Systems, including Sutter Health, St. Luke’s Idaho, Tahoe Forest as an employee and as a consultant, I have worked with dozen’s of other Health Systems.</description>
