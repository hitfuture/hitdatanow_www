title: "Data Focused Software Development"
description: "<p>My first job at a startup company was with a team that was developing a business analytics system for the healthcare domain.  My position was focused on the software development of the ability to create an interactive visualization system and would run on both Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows.  Our company succeeded in deploying this data-driven solution, and it was built in one of the first Object Oriented programming languages in the early 1990s.  After we sold the company, I became a consultant focused on data-driven development for the healthcare industry.  I worked for many years in different companies, and for some Health systems.  Development of these new solutions was a passion of mine, and I thought I'd never stop doing programming.  The truth is, even with leadership roles, I never did stop programming based on a data-driven world.   </p>"
