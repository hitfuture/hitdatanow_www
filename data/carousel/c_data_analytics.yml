description: "<p>After taking on the performance improvement project in the O/R, a new job was created for me in Nursing Administration.  The position was created for 'Patient Care Operations Analyst'. I focused on applying statistics and data visualization for the Nursing Administration group in the late 1980s.  While I continued to study in the are of software development related to data, the I.T. department reached out to me and hired me as a Data Analyst.  We built analytics for the finanical, and operations departments.  This was a great job, and I enjoyed working with the team on the data side for healthcare.  When the organization decided to build their own Electronic Medical Record in the early 1990s, I was promoted to a position Strategic Planning Analyst in the I.T. department.  I was able to not only work on the EMR, I also project managed the implementation of technology to adopt Capitation in our Healthcare organization.  </p>"
