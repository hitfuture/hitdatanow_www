description: "<p>I was thrilled to get my first job at Sutter Health's Surgery Department in my youth. I became very interested in the medical sciences and was focused on this part of the Healthcare industry.  Working with some of the great Neuro Surgeons, Orthopedic Surgeons, Anesthesiologists, Nurses, and others, I decided that I would take on education in the medical field.  My college experience at Sacramento City College was focused on biological sciences, mathematics, physics, and engineering.  Working in the O/R made me passionate about the future of Healthcare, and ended up keeping me in the industry for over thirty years. While I thought I would stay in the medical sciences, I ended up becoming extremely focused on applying software to the industry because I understood the opportunities in improving performance for Healthcare, and how I should create a better experience for the clinical staff so they could focus on their patients</p>"
