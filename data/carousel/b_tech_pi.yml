description: "<p> When I had finished my first performance improvement project at Sutter Health, I was fortunate to become the 'Patient Care Operations Analyst' in the late 80s.  My role in this area was to analyze the operations of the nursing side of healthcare so that the leaders could help improve performance and reduce cost in the Hospital. I was able to apply statistics, and data management to enable a new capability for this organization.  This was a great transition from my former position, and I now could focus entirely on the analysis side of the world.  I had been doing this work for about a year, and then the manager in the I.T. department reached out to me to recruit me to work on the side of data analytics. </p> <p>As a Programmer Analyst, I was able to lead a project that was a Perinatal Management System that provided a data repository, and reporting applications to enable knowledge of this to providers, and administrators. I also took in the ability to re-engineer an existing mainframe-based system into a client/server application for the medical staff department at several facilities.  </p> <p> My next position at Sutter was a Strategic Planning Analyst focused on the deployment of the Healthcare Information System.  I also took on project management in multiple areas including the adoption of the right technology to enable Capitation based are</p><p>These jobs brought me full on to the technology side of healthcare, and I became very dedicated to the industry for the rest of my career. </p>"
