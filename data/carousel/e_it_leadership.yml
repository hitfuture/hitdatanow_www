title: "IT Leadership"
description: "<p>Much of my leadership positions have happened since the about 2006.  While I did have to lead roles in the past, when I was consulting for Tahoe Forest Health System in the data arena, I was given a new job in management.  That job evolved to where I became the 'Director of Development.'  This title was aligned with the term Dev/Ops which was established in technology in the late 2000s.  My role was associated with the deployment of new technologies for the organization.  I managed application deployment, business intelligence, and establishing a more stable environment. I left Tahoe Forest during the recession, and moved up to St. Luke's in Idaho to manage teams that were focused on installing a new hospital in Twin Falls.  That project was very successful, and the CIO put me into the role of the Director of Infrastructure and Operations.  My objective was to extend the culture and deploy stable technologies. This was definitely a challenge, and we made a lot of change during the five years I lead this large team.  In 2014, I realized that I still was obsessed with data, and I had taken on education in Data Science in my off time. It was fascinating, and I ended up going to a start-up company where I became the Chief Technology Strategist leading the development of Data Science solutions for Healthcare.  That was very exciting, and one of the important things was to adopt Dev/Ops in the realm of Data Science.  Leadership is essential, and sometimes challenging.  </p>"
