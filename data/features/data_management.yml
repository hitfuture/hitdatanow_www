description: "My experience in my career has been very focused on data to analyze and predict the future in the medical industry. To make this successful, I have been accountable for managing the data. Data management is critical, I have extended it in the areas of governance and project management. Since I have utilized diverse types of databases, and other data sources, I understand the challenges with managing data and implementing better solutions to allow for proper management. I have applied Machine Learning to understand data better, with tools like classification, clustering, and also using Natural Language Processing (N.L.P.). I also have built out rule-based systems to understand complex data better."
