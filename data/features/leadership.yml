description: "I have been very lucky to become an official leader in the Healthcare Industry over the last 13 years.  In the start of my career, I always wanted to the data analysis and development side of the world so I avoided taking on official jobs as a manager.  Since I did have my own consulting business, I was a leader, yet I didn't recognize that that was one of my skills.  I became a director at a Healthsystem when I was consulting to handle data integration work, and they hired me.  It ended up that I really like working with teams, and realize that being a leader, means that you are listening to the experts that report to you, and taking on the best advise you can get from them.  Communication is one of the most important parts of this world, and as I've learned, you really need to handle non-verbal communication as well as verbal communication.  Taking on leadership has been fun, and you can see some of my non-verbal communication by clicking on the icon above."
