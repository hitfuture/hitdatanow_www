description: "I have provided software development in Healthcare, Banking, and some other areas over the last 30 years.  I have utilized multiple languages based on Object-Oriented Programming, and Functional languages which include Smalltalk, Java, C, R, Python, and other languages.    This makes sense with the adoption of the Electronic Health Record. I have had the ability to do this development for product development at Software development companies, and verticles in the areas of Healthcare, Banking, and Consulting businesses. I always love to keep my hands on the keyboard, and learn new languages so I will continue to keep programming moving forward. I tend to always integrate this work into the data side of the world, and you can see my skills that handle this area."
