description: "Planning in the past required a large investment in the waterfall project management process.  I have been dedicated to adopting agile methodologies that allow you to deliver the right solution at the right time with a decent investment.  Development and Operations have been living in their own silos in the past.  To eliminate this, I have adopted Dev/Ops in my last Chief Technologist position so that we could deliver products correctly for our customers.  I can help you integrate your teams so that they are able to continuously deliver solutions that enable the care givers and the people that support them to provide a better patient experience, and to lower cost."
