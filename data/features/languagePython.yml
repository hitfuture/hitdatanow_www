description: "Python is the fastest growing language in the world. The reason is that there is a lot of value in this language since it is both functional, has a good environment for Object-Oriented programing.  My personal experience with Python is in the realm of Data Science and Data management.  I use it to enable good access to data, and to analyze data well.  I have developed several solutions based on Python, and I expect that I will continue to use it, and R in the Data Science realm."
